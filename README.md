The Odin Project - Project: TicTacToe

A Tic Tac Toe game written in JavaScript for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)

This project utilizes two module factories for the game board and game controller. 
These can be run from the console to play the entire game and are tested with 
Jest. Another module factory is used to control the UI. The goal of the project 
assignment was to "use as little global code as possible."

The design of the website is responsive, keeping phone usage in mind.
